## Notes & shoutouts

The most difficult work in this project is how to connect to the API in different situations. Also, I have spent a lot of time in connecting 2 route data. In this process, I have learned the relationship between the different combination of the route. Shoutout to Prof. Afsar for helping me to go through my project.
